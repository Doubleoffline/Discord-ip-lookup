This is a Discord bot that uses IPinfo API to lookup the details of an IP address. It is built using Python and designed to be easy to use, with simple commands that retrieve useful information about any IP address.

The bot listens for the ```!ip``` command and takes an IP address as an argument. It then sends a request to the IPinfo API to retrieve information about the IP address and displays this information in a formatted message using Discord's embed feature.

This bot is useful for anyone who needs to quickly lookup details about an IP address. It is easy to install and configure, and can be customized to fit your specific needs.
